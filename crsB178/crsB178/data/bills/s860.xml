	4/14/2011--Introduced.
Requires the Commissioner of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection (CBP): (1) to report on whether the methodologies and technologies used by CBP to screen for and detect the presence of chemical, nuclear, biological, and radiological weapons in municipal solid waste are as effective as those used to screen for such materials in other items of commerce entering the United States through commercial motor vehicle transport; and (2) if such waste screening measures are less effective, to report on the actions CBP will take to achieve the same level of effectiveness. Bars entry of such waste into the United States if such actions are not fully implemented within a specified period following such report until such screening measures are certified to be as effective for such waste as for other items entering U.S. commerce.
