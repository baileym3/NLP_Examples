	<summary>
	9/22/2012--Passed Senate amended. Condemns the politically motivated prosecution and imprisonment of former Prime Minister of Ukraine Yulia Tymoshenko. Expresses concern that: (1) the politicized prosecutions and detention of Ms. Tymoshenko and other members of her party took place in a country that is scheduled to assume chairmanship of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in 2013, and (2) the politicized detention of Ms. Tymoshenko threatens to jeopardize ties between the United States and Ukraine. Calls for Ukraine to release Ms. Tymoshenko, to provide her with timely access to medical care, and to conduct the October parliamentary elections in a manner consistent with OSCE standards. Calls on the Department of State to institute a visa ban against those responsible for the imprisonment and mistreatment of Ms. Tymoshenko and the more than dozen political leaders associated with the 2004 Orange Revolution.
