	12/20/2012--Passed Senate amended. Directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to convey specified property, including all land appurtenances, in Kotzebue, Alaska, to the Maniilaq Association for use in connection with health and social services programs. Requires such conveyance to be made by a warranty deed without consideration and without imposing any obligation, term, or condition, on the Maniilaq Association, or U.S. reversionary interest, other than that as required by this Act or under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act. Supersedes and renders of no future effect the Secretary's conveyance of title on any quitclaim deed for such properties that was executed by the Secretary and the Maniilaq Association. Shields the Maniilaq Association from liability for soil, surface water, groundwater, or other contamination resulting from the disposal, release, or presence of environmental contamination, including oil or petroleum products, or hazardous substances on any of the property on or before the date on which all of the properties were conveyed by quitclaim deed. Accords to the Secretary any easement or access to the conveyed property as may be necessary to satisfy any retained obligations and liability. Requires the Secretary to be in compliance with requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) respecting certain deeds for the transfer of U.S. owned real property on which any hazardous substance was stored for one year or more, disposed of, or known to have been released.
