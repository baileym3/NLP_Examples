	<summary>
	3/27/2012--Introduced.
Shared Responsibility in Preserving America's Future Act - Amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose, in taxable years beginning after 2012 and before 2023, an additional 5% tax on individual taxpayers whose modified adjusted gross income exceeds $1 million (adjusted for inflation after 2013). Defines &quot;modified adjusted gross income&quot; as adjusted gross income reduced by the excess of: (1) gross income from a trade or business which is not a passive activity and with respect to which wages are paid to at least one full-time equivalent employee, over (2) the tax deductions properly allocable to such income. Makes this additional tax contingent upon the submission and ratification of a proposed amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget or limiting spending.
