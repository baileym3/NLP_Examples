	<summary>
	3/3/2011--Introduced.
Amends the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to: (1) make communities that reconstruct and improve flood protection systems (in addition to constructing them) eligible for premium flood insurance rates under such Act; and (2) allow entities that own, operate, maintain, or repair flood protection systems (instead of a federal agency) to determine whether a flood protection system is restorable.
