Recognizes and honors the life of Agustin Roman (auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Miami, Florida, and the first Cuban to be appointed bishop in the United States), his spiritual leadership, and his dedication to freedom and faith. Offers condolences to his family, friends, and loved ones on his passing. Calls on the United States to continue policies that promote respect for the fundamental principles of religious freedom, democracy, and human rights in Cuba, in a manner consistent with the aspirations of the people of Cuba.
