	7/19/2011--Introduced.
American Land Act - Authorizes the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture (USDA), for FY2012-FY2016, to offer for competitive sale by auction 8% of the federal lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and 8% of the National Forest System lands. Requires the lands to be sold to be configured so as to maximize their marketability or to achieve management objectives. Permits either Secretary to include the mineral rights in a sale of land under this Act land for not more than 50% of the total acreage sold, if such inclusion is likely to maximize that land's marketability.
