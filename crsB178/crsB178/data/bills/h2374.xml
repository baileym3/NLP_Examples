	<summary>
	6/24/2011--Introduced.
Requires the event data recorder in a motor vehicle and any data recorded on such a recorder to be considered the property of the vehicle owner. Makes retrieval of such data by anyone other than the vehicle owner unlawful, except: (1) with the owner's consent; (2) in response to a court order; (3) by a vehicle dealer or an automotive technician for servicing the vehicle; or (4) for improving vehicle safety, provided the identity of the registered owner or driver is not disclosed. Gives the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) the authority to enforce this Act. Makes it unlawful to manufacture, sell, or import new motor vehicles manufactured after 2011 (bearing a model year of 2013 or later) that are equipped with event data recorders, unless those recorders can be disabled by the vehicle owner.
