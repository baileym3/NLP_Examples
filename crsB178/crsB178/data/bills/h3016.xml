Directs the Secretaries of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) to jointly operate the Federal Recovery Coordination Program, a program that assists: (1) members of the Armed Forces with severe or catastrophic injuries or illnesses who are unlikely to return to active duty and will most likely be medically separated, and (2) members and veterans whose individual circumstances (illness, injury, mental health, etc.) are likely to cause difficulties in transitioning to civilian life. Requires the Secretaries to: (1) develop a plan to carry out the Program and submit such plan to the congressional defense and veterans committees, and (2) submit a subsequent report describing and evaluating plan implementation.
