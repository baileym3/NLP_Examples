Deport Convicted Foreign Criminals Act of 2011 - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) to report quarterly to Congress regarding each country that has refused or unreasonably delayed repatriation of an alien who is a citizen, subject, national, or resident of such country. Requires a report to include the aliens' detention and criminal status. Prohibits the Secretary of State, upon the passage of specified periods of time, from issuing certain nonimmigrant (including certain diplomatic) visas and immigrant visas to a citizen, subject, national, or resident of a listed country. Directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to notify the chief law enforcement officer of the state and of the local jurisdiction in which an alien who has been detained by the United States is released. Defines &quot;alien&quot; as an individual who has been detained by the United States and has received a final order of removal but has not been removed.
