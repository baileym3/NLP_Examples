	4/26/2012--Introduced.
Livestock Disaster Protection Act - Amends the Federal Crop Insurance Act to make FY2012-FY2017 livestock indemnity payments (at 75% of market value) to eligible producers on farms that have incurred livestock death losses in excess of the normal mortality due to: (1) attacks by animals reintroduced into the wild by the federal government or protected by federal law, including wolves and avian predators; or (2) adverse weather, disease, or wildfires. Provides FY2012-FY2017 compensation for losses to eligible livestock producers for livestock grazing losses due to specified drought or fire circumstances. Excludes from coverage grazing losses on conservation reserve program land used for haying or grazing. Provides FY2012-FY2017 emergency relief to eligible producers of livestock, honey bees, and farm-raised fish to reduce losses due to disease, adverse weather, or other conditions, such as blizzards and wildfires.
