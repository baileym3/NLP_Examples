	12/6/2012--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Animal Welfare Act to exclude from the definition of &quot;exhibitor,&quot; for purposes of the licensing and other regulatory requirements of the Act, owners of common, domesticated household pets who derive less than a substantial portion of income from a nonprimary source for exhibiting an animal that exclusively resides at the residence of the pet owner.
