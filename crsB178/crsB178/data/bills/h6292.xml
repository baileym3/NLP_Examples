Prohibits the Secretary of State from issuing any visa to, and the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) from permitting entry to the United States of, any such identified official, as well as any immediate family members of such official. Makes such ban permanent if an identified U.S. citizen dies while in foreign custody.
