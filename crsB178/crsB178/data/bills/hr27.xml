Ratifies the election of Representative-elect Sessions to a standing committee and his participation in its proceedings. Considers the measures delivered by him to the Speaker for referral as introduced. Retains the numbers assigned. Considers as valid: (1) any submissions to the Congressional Record by Representative-elect Sessions or Representative-elect Fitzpatrick; and (2) any cosponsor lists naming them. Ratifies any non-voting participation by them in floor proceedings.
