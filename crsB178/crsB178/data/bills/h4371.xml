Fairness for World War II and Korean War Spouses Act - Makes the annual rate of pension paid to the surviving spouses of veterans of World War II or the Korean conflict the greater of the following amounts, reduced by the survivor's annual income: (1) the current limit applicable to surviving spouses of veterans of any period of war; or (2) the amount equal to the poverty line, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the prior year. Prohibits benefits paid by any federal entity from being included in the determination of annual income.
