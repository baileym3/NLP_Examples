	<summary>
	12/11/2012--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to make the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) a &quot;covered agency&quot; that may share information with another covered agency or any other federal agency without waiving any privilege applicable to the information. Prohibits information submitted to the CFPB in the course of its supervisory or regulatory process from being construed as waiving, destroying, or affecting any privilege that may be claimed with respect to such information under federal or state law as to any person or entity other than the CFPB, another federal banking agency, a state bank supervisor, or a foreign banking authority.
