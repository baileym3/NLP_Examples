	3/1/2012--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.)

Congratulates the U.S. Armed Forces, the National Parks Service, the Maryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission, and all other organizations and individuals involved in preserving and promoting the history of this great country, and supports their commemoration of the War of 1812 and &quot;The Star Spangled Banner.&quot; Calls on the people of the United States to join in the commemoration of the bicentennial of the War of 1812 and &quot;The Star Spangled Banner,&quot; and to celebrate that at the end of the war, as Francis Scott Key wrote, &quot;our flag was still there.&quot;
