	2/13/2012--Reported to Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Requires the Supreme Court to permit television coverage of all open sessions of the Court unless it decides by majority vote that allowing such coverage in a particular case would violate the due process rights of any of the parties involved.
