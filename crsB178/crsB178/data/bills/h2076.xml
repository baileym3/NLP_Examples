	11/17/2011--Reported to Senate amended. Investigative Assistance for Violent Crimes Act of 2011 - Authorizes the Attorney General (AG) and the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), at the request of an appropriate law enforcement official of a state or political subdivision, to assist in the investigation of violent acts and shootings occurring in venues such as schools, colleges, universities, nonfederal office buildings, malls, and other public places, and in the investigation of mass killings and attempted mass killings. Defines &quot;mass killings&quot; as three or more killings in a single incident. Authorizes the AG to pay rewards up to $3 million (currently, $2 million), subject to exceptions, pursuant to public advertisements for assistance to the Department of Justice (DOJ). Allows funds available to the AG for the FBI for detection, investigation, and prosecution of crimes against the United States to be used to deploy tactical response, command and control, and other crisis-management assets of the FBI, as appropriate. Requires any such conduct or assistance to be presumptively within the scope of federal office or employment.
