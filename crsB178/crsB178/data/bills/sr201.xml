	<summary>
	10/6/2011--Passed Senate amended. States that the Senate: (1) acknowledges that the framework of anti-Chinese legislation, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, is incompatible with the basic founding principles of equality recognized in the Declaration of Independence; (2) regrets passing six decades of legislation targeting the Chinese people for physical and political exclusion; and (3) reaffirms its commitment to preserving the same civil rights and constitutional protections for people of Chinese or other Asian descent in the United States accorded to all others. States that nothing in this resolution may be construed to authorize or support, or serve as a settlement of, any claim against the United States.
