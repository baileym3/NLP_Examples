Patent Continuing Disclosure Act - Amends federal patent law to prohibit fining for false marking (counterfeiting or imitating patent marks to deceive the public into believing articles are patented) any person who makes, uses, offers for sale, or sells within or imports into the United States, an expired patent item affixed with the word &quot;patent&quot; (along with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office [USPTO] patent number granted to that person) if, after the expiration of the patent: (1) there is no change in the manufacturing or production process, or (2) the word &quot;expired&quot; is placed before the word &quot;patent&quot; (or the patent number) when a change in the manufacturing or production process occurs. Defines the term &quot;change in the manufacturing or production process&quot; as an intentional expansion, enhancement, improvement, or repair, that suspends, for a period of at least 24 hours, the normal operating procedures through which the item is assembled, made, crafted, manufactured, built, or fabricated from individual components or raw materials, or both.
