	<summary>
	11/10/2011--Reported to Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Respect for Marriage Act of 2011 - Amends the Defense of Marriage Act to repeal a provision that prohibited a state, territory, possession, or Indian tribe from being required to recognize any public act, record, or judicial proceeding of any other state, territory, possession, or tribe respecting a same sex marriage. Amends the federal rules of construction added by such Act concerning the definitions of &quot;marriage&quot; and &quot;spouse&quot; to provide that, for purposes of any federal law in which marital status is a factor, an individual shall be considered married if that individual's marriage is valid in the state where the marriage was entered into or, in the case of a marriage entered into outside any state, if the marriage is valid in the place where entered into and the marriage could have been entered into in a state. Removes the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; (currently, a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife).
