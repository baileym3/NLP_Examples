	<summary>
	11/10/2011--Reported to House without amendment, Part I. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Piracy Suppression Act of 2011 - (Sec. 2) Amends the Revised Statutes to subject any person who commits an act of piracy to the penalty of death or imprisonment for life. Defines &quot;act of piracy&quot; to mean any: (1) illegal act of violence, detention, or depredation, committed by the crew or passengers of a vessel against a vessel, person, or property on the high seas or in any other place outside the jurisdiction of a state (including inciting or facilitating such an act of piracy); and (2) any voluntary act of participation in the operation of a vessel with knowledge that it is a pirate ship. (Sec. 3) Directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to seek reimbursement from a foreign country for the cost of U.S. action to protect or defend foreign-flagged vessels of the country from a pirate attack, including the cost of U.S. action to deter the attack. Authorizes the waiver of such costs under certain circumstances. (Sec. 4) Directs the Secretary of Transportation (DOT) to establish a training program for U.S. mariners on the use of force against pirates. (Sec. 5) Directs the DOT Secretary to require each federal agency responsible for the transport of equipment, materials, or commodities (government-impelled cargo) by U.S. vessels to provide armed personnel aboard such vessels while transiting high-risk waters. Requires each agency to reimburse vessel owners or operators for the cost of providing armed personnel. (Sec. 6) Directs the Comptroller General to report to Congress on efforts to track ransom payments paid to pirates operating in the waters off Somalia and improve their prosecution.
