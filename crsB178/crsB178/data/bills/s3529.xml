General Duty Clarification Act of 2012 - Amends the Clean Air Act, with respect to provisions relating to the prevention of accidental releases of hazardous air pollutants, to provide that no entity may be found in violation of such provisions until the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA): (1) promulgates final regulations establishing criteria defining the terms &quot;extremely hazardous substance,&quot; &quot;appropriate hazard assessment techniques,&quot; and &quot;design and maintain a safe facility&quot;; and (2) issues guidelines to ensure that enforcement of such provisions is handled by the regional offices of EPA in a uniform and appropriate manner across all regions of the United States. Modifies the definition of &quot;accidental release&quot; to exclude an emission resulting from an intentional act.
