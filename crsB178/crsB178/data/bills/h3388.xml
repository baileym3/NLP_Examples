	7/23/2012--Passed House amended. (This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on July 17, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Wood-Pawcatuck Watershed Protection Act - Amends the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to designate for study for potential addition to the national wild and scenic rivers system specified segments of the Beaver, Chipuxet, Queen, Wood, and Pawcatuck Rivers in Rhode Island and Connecticut. Requires the study of such rivers' designation to: (1) include the effect of designation on existing commercial and recreational activities, energy production and transmission infrastructure, and the authority of state and local governments to manage such activities; and (2) identify authorities allowing the influence of local land use decisions or restrictions on non-federal land, condemnation authorities, and all private property located in the study area.
