	3/8/2012--Introduced.
Federal Real Property Asset Management Reform Act of 2012 - Imposes new duties on federal agencies that have statutory authority to control real property (landholding agencies), including the duty to maintain adequate inventory controls and accountability systems for such property, to report underutilized property, and to establish goals for reducing inventories of underutilized property. Defines &quot;underutilized property&quot; as federal property that is excess, surplus, underperforming, or otherwise not meeting the needs of the federal government. Establishes within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) the Federal Real Property Council. Sets forth the duties of the Council, including to: (1) establish an asset management plan that includes performance measures to determine the effectiveness of federal real property management; (2) analyze and report on the existing inventory of federal civilian real properties and the condition of such properties; and (3) submit to the OMB Director an asset disposal plan that includes an annual goal to be used by landholding agencies in reducing, by not later than two years after the enactment of this Act, underutilized property in the inventory of the federal government. Requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA) to establish and maintain a single, comprehensive, and descriptive database of all real property under the custody and control of all landholding agencies. Requires the OMB Director to establish an expedited disposal program for underutilized federal properties, under which such properties must be sold for not less than fair market value and the proceeds of such sales must exceed the costs of disposal. Directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): (1) to make grants to private nonprofit organizations through the continuum of care program to purchase property to assist the homeless; and (2) in awarding such grants, to give preference to organizations that operate within areas in which federal real property is being sold under the disposal program authorized by this Act.
