Requires, also, that 50% of such funds be suballocated for projects to reduce emissions within areas designated as nonattainment or maintenance for ozone, carbon monoxide, or PM2.5, including diesel retrofits. Requires each tier I MPO representing a nonattainment or maintenance area (population of more than 50,000 individuals) to develop a performance plan that describes projects that will achieve certain emission and traffic congestion reduction targets. Authorizes a state to reserve a specified amount of CMAQ program funds for: (1) the transportation enhancements, recreational trails, and safe routes to school programs; and (2) certain road improvement projects. Revises and replaces the Puerto Rico highway program with the Territorial and Puerto Rico highway program. (Effectively consolidates the programs.) Makes certain allocations for the Puerto Rico highway and territorial highway programs for resurfacing and reconstruction, highway safety improvement, transportation mobility program, preventive maintenance, and ferry boats and terminal facilities projects. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish a national freight program to improve movement of freight on highways, including freight intermodal connectors and aerotropolis transportation systems; and (2) develop, periodically update, and post on the DOT website a national freight strategic plan.

(Currently, an MPO must be designated for each urbanized area with a population of more than 50,000 individuals.) Prescribes a tier I and tier II MPO designation system based on population. Requires MPOs, in developing metropolitan transportation plans and transportation improvement programs (TIPs) for metropolitan planning areas, to use a process that establishes certain performance measures and targets for the metropolitan transportation planning of federal-aid highway projects. Requires each state, in developing a statewide transportation plan and a statewide transportation improvement program (STIP), to use similar performance measures and targets for the statewide transportation planning of federal-aid highway projects. Requires each state to incorporate the metropolitan transportation plans and TIPs for each metropolitan area into the statewide transportation plan and STIP. Declares that it is in the interest of the United States to focus the federal-aid highway program on certain national goals, including to: (1) significantly reduce traffic fatalities and serious injuries on all public roads, (2) maintain the highway infrastructure system in a state of good repair, (3) improve the efficiency of the surface transportation system, (4) improve the national freight network and support regional economic development, and (5) enhance the performance of the transportation system while protecting the natural environment. Directs the Secretary to carry out a project delivery acceleration initiative to identify, develop, and advance the use of best practices and deployment of technology and innovation to accelerate project delivery and to reduce project costs for transportation projects and programs while enhancing safety and protecting the environment.

Authorizes a lead authority (DOT) operating administration or secretarial office to apply a categorical exclusion (that does not involve significant environmental impact) for other components of a multimodal transportation project if specified conditions are met. (A &quot;categorical exclusion&quot; is a category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment and which have been found to have no such effect in procedures adopted by a federal agency in implementation of environmental regulations and for which, therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.) Revises and makes permanent the surface transportation project delivery pilot program. Directs the Secretary to publish notice of proposed rulemaking for categorical exclusions for federal-aid highway projects that are located solely within the right-of-way of an existing highway and are intended to improve safety, alleviate congestion, or improve pavement conditions.

Directs the Secretary to develop a national ITS architecture and supporting ITS standards to promote the use of systems engineering methods in the deployment of intelligent transportation systems and technologies as a component of U.S. surface transportation systems. America Fast Forward Financing Innovation Act of 2011 - Amends the the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA) to revise DOT's TIFIA program of direct loans, loan guarantees, and credit for surface transportation projects. Revises TIFIA program eligibility requirements to make a project eligible to receive credit assistance if the entity proposing a project submits a letter of interest before submission of a project application and the project meets certain creditworthiness criteria. Requires the Secretary to establish a rolling application process in which eligible projects shall receive credit on terms acceptable to the Secretary, if adequate funds are available to cover the subsidy costs of the federal credit instrument. Authorizes a project sponsor in cases where there is not adequate funding available to fund a credit instrument to elect to enter into a master credit agreement and wait until the following fiscal year to receive credit assistance. Increases from 33% to 49% the maximum amount of direct loans, loan guarantees, and credit for project costs. Requires the Secretary to: (1) determine whether the estimated balance of the HTF (other than the Mass Transit Account) will fall below $2 billion in FY2012 or $1 billion in FY2013; and (2) calculate, if either event occurs, the amount by which the obligation limitation on federal-aid highway programs for each fiscal year would have to be reduced to prevent such an occurrence, and then distribute the limitation to the states (minus any reduction).
