	6/12/2012--Introduced.
Justice Exists for All of Us Act of 2012 - Prohibits a state, for each fiscal year beginning after three years after enactment of this Act, from having in effect a law or policy that: (1) allows a person to use deadly force when such person is threatened and that does not, except where the person is a victim of domestic violence, impose a duty to retreat before using such force in any place where that person is lawfully present (commonly known as a &quot;stand your ground law&quot;); or (2) allows the establishment, organization, or operation of, or participation in, a Neighborhood Watch program that is not registered with the local law enforcement agency and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Allows the Attorney General to authorize up to two one-year extensions of such deadline. Provides that a state that fails to substantially implement this Act for any fiscal year shall not receive 20% of the funds that would otherwise be allocated to it under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program. Provides for alternative procedures for compliance by a state that is unable to substantially implement this Act because of a conflict with the state's constitution.
