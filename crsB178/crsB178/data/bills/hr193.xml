	<summary>
	3/31/2011--Introduced.
Calls on Egypt to: (1) bring about the safe return of U.S. citizens Noor and Ramsay Bower to their father, Colin Bower, in the United States; and (2) stop using its security forces in aiding the continued unlawful retention of Noor and Ramsay Bower. Urges Egypt and all other nations to join and fully participate in the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction and to establish procedures to address the tragedy of child abductions. Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the United States should: (1) urge other nations like Egypt to become parties to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, (2) take measures to ensure that Hague Convention partners and countries that are not Convention partners return abducted children to the United States, and (3) pursue criminal extradition of abducting parents where resolution of the abduction is not otherwise obtainable.
