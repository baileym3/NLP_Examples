	<summary>
	11/8/2011--Public Law. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Withdraws approximately 512 acres of covered land in Arizona (consisting of approximately 300 feet of the crest of the Craigin Dam and associated spillway, the reservoir pool of that Dam, and a specified corridor of land) from all forms of: (1) entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under all laws pertaining to mineral and geothermal leasing or mineral materials.
Grants the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, exclusive jurisdiction to manage the Craigin Project in accordance with the Arizona Water Settlements Act. Defines the &quot;Craigin Project&quot; to include the Craigin Dam, its reservoir pool, and Salt River Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District or Bureau of Reclamation structures and facilities used for the Project. Requires that Secretary and the District to ensure the compliance of each activity carried out at the Project with applicable federal environmental law.
Grants the Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Chief of the Forest Service, administrative jurisdiction over land management activities on the covered land and other appropriate management activities that do not conflict with, or adversely affect, the operation, maintenance, or replacement (including repair) of the Project.
Authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior, in coordination with the District, to enter into an agreement under which the Secretary of Agriculture may: (1) undertake any other appropriate management activity in accordance with applicable law that will improve the management and safety of the covered land and other land managed by the Secretary of Agriculture if the activity does not conflict with, or adversely affect, the operation, maintenance, or replacement (including repair) of the Project; and (2) carry out any emergency activities on the covered land.
