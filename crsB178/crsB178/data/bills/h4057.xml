	9/11/2012--Passed House amended. (This measure has not been amended since it was reported to the House on September 10, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to develop a comprehensive policy to improve outreach and transparency to veterans and members of the Armed Forces (members) through the provision of information on institutions of higher learning. Requires such information to: (1) include accreditation information and a description of available federal aid programs, and (2) be provided through hyperlinks on the VA website. Prohibits the Secretary from approving an educational institution that provides any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based on success in securing enrollments. Requires the Secretary, in developing the policy, to conduct a market survey to determine the availability of a commercially available off-the-shelf online tool that: (1) allows veterans to determine whether they are academically ready to engage in postsecondary education and training opportunities, and (2) provides a list of providers of such opportunities. Directs the Secretary to report to the congressional veterans committees on: (1) the policy developed, (2) a plan to implement the policy, and (3) survey results. Directs the Secretary, as a condition of a grant or contract to a state for certain veterans' employment and training programs, to require the state to demonstrate the consideration of any military training received by a veteran when approving or denying a commercial driver's license or certification as an emergency or nonemergency medical professional. Prohibits the Secretary from making a grant or providing other assistance to any entity for the provision of housing or housing services to homeless veterans unless such entity submits to the Secretary a certification that the building proposed for such housing or services is in compliance with all local codes relevant to operations and level of care provided, as well as any other local requirements regarding the condition of the structure and the operation of the supportive housing or service center. Directs the Secretary to: (1) establish and maintain an open pit burn registry for members deployed in a contingency operation in Iraq or Afghanistan who may have been exposed to toxic chemicals and fumes caused by open burn pits used for disposing solid waste, (2) include in such registry information necessary to ascertain and monitor the health effects of such exposure, (3) develop a public information campaign to inform eligible individuals about the registry, and (4) periodically notify such individuals of significant developments in the study and treatment of conditions associated with such exposure. Requires the Secretary to: (1) contract with an independent scientific organization to develop a report assessing the effectiveness of actions taken to collect and maintain information on the health effects of such exposure, and (2) submit the completed report to Congress. Prohibits the Secretary from paying more than $1 million in Senior Executive Service performance awards for each of FY2013-FY2017.
