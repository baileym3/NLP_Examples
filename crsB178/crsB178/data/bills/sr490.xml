	11/15/2012--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Designates the week of September 16, 2012, as Mitochondrial Disease Awareness Week. Reaffirms the importance of an enhanced and coordinated research effort aimed at improving the understanding of primary mitochondrial diseases and the development of treatments and cures. Commends the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for its efforts to organize a symposium to improve the understanding of mitochondrial diseases and to enhance collaboration and chart a course for future mitochondrial disease research. Encourages NIH to place a greater priority on research into primary mitochondrial diseases, to continue to explore the connections between mitochondrial dysfunction and other systemic diseases, to promote collaboration and coordination among the Institutes of NIH and with other organizations, and to consider the recommendations and address research directions identified in the white paper developed from the symposium.
