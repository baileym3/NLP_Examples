	<summary>
	5/11/2011--Introduced.
Prohibits any federal department, agency, or court from taking any action that would prohibit, interfere with, regulate, or otherwise restrict the interstate traffic of milk, or a milk product, that is unpasteurized and packaged for direct human consumption based on the determination that solely because the milk or milk product is unpasteurized, it is adulterated, misbranded, or otherwise in violation of federal law.
