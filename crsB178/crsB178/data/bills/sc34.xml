	<summary>
	1/30/2012--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Mourns the loss of Vaclav Havel and offers condolences to the Havel family and the people of the Czech Republic. Recognizes Vaclav Havel's: (1) courage and commitment to democratic values in the face of communist repression, (2) historical legacy in defeating communism and building a democratic Europe, and (3) solidarity with democratic dissidents throughout the world and support for the expansion of freedom, including in Belarus, Iran, Cuba, and Burma. Reaffirms the commitment of the United States to the causes of freedom, democracy, and human rights for which Vaclav Havel stood.
