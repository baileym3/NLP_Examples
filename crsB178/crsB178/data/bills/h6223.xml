	12/17/2012--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was passed by the House on December 5, 2012. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Amends the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 to consider the period of time that a person was employed by the Chief of Mission or the U.S. Armed Forces, under contract with the Chief of Mission or the U.S. Armed Forces, or was employed by a firm or corporation under contract with the Chief of Mission or the U.S. Armed Forces as a translator, interpreter, or in an executive or managerial level security position as a period of U.S. residence and physical presence for naturalization purposes if at least a portion of such period was spent abroad working directly in such capacity for the Chief of Mission or U.S. Armed Forces. Makes such amendment effective as if included in the enactment of a specified section of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006.
