	<summary>
	5/16/2012--Passed House amended. Amends Public Law 99-548, commonly known as the Mesquite Lands Act of 1986 (the Act), to require proceeds from sales in the fourth area to be used for the implementation of a multispecies habitat conservation plan for the Virgin River in Clark County, Nevada, including any associated groundwater monitoring plan. Extends, until November 29, 2020, withdrawal and purchase authority with respect to the fifth and sixth areas. Amends the Act to provide for the conveyance to the city of Mesquite, Nevada, of the approximately 218 acres of land identified as Hiatus on the map entitled &quot;Mesquite Airport Conveyance &quot; and dated January 13, 2012, from among the up to 2,560 acres of public land to be selected by the city from the sixth area. Amends the Act to require, if the public land conveyed to the city of Mesquite from the sixth area is not being used by the city as an airport or for another public purpose, such land to revert to the United States, at the option of the Secretary of the Interior, except that the city shall have an exclusive right to purchase the land. Grants the city of Mesquite, until November 29, 2020, the exclusive right to purchase the parcels of public land from the sixth area that the Secretary did not convey to the city pursuant to the Act. Requires the proceeds from the sale of each parcel to be deposited into the General Treasury.
