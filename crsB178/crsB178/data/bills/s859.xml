Public Agency Accountability for Sexual Harassment Act - Prohibits sexual harassment (as defined under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) by any individual who is an agent of an organization or government and who administers a program or activity from which an annual benefit of more than $5,000 is derived. Requires such organization or government to terminate its relationship with an agent who engages in sexual harassment and to disclose the terms of any settlement resulting from an act of sexual harassment by an agent. Sets forth enforcement provisions and fines for violations of this Act. Declares that states shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment from suit in federal court for a violation of this Act and that states waive sovereign immunity by receiving federal assistance.
