	6/14/2012--Introduced.
Recognizes: (1) that prostate cancer has created a health crisis for African American men; and (2) the importance of health coverage and access to care, as well as promoting informed decision-making between men and their doctors, in screening and treatment options for prostate cancer. Urges federal agencies to support: (1) prostate cancer research and education, awareness, and early detection efforts at the grass roots levels to end such crisis; and (2) the Office of Minority Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in improving health and health care outcomes for African Americans at an elevated risk of prostate cancer. Urges investment by the National Cancer Institute and National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, other elements of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Department of Defense (DOD) in research focusing on the improvement of early detection and treatment of prostate cancer.
