Recognizes the proud history of the 24th Infantry Division (the 24th) and its soldiers who made countless sacrifices to protect the nation's freedom. Remembers with profound gratitude, sorrow, and respect the 14 soldiers of the 24th who received the Medal of Honor. Encourages the provision of an appropriate site in Arlington National Cemetery for a memorial marker to honor the memory of those 14 soldiers, as long as the Secretary of the Army has exclusive authority to approve the design and site of the marker.
