	<summary>
	3/14/2012--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary of that version is repeated here.) Expresses: (1) support for the goals and ideals of Multiple Sclerosis Awareness Week, and (2) gratitude to the family members and friends of those living with multiple sclerosis. Reaffirms the U.S. commitment to creating a world free of multiple sclerosis by promoting: (1) awareness about people who are affected with multiple sclerosis; and (2) new education programs, supporting research, and expanding access to medical treatment. Salutes the health care professionals and medical researchers who assist those individuals affected with multiple sclerosis and continue to work to find ways to stop the progression of the disease, restore nerve function, and end multiple sclerosis forever.
