Stand Against Violence and Empower Native Women Act or the SAVE Native Women Act - Amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to include sex trafficking as a target of the grants to Indian tribal governments to combat violent crime against Indian women. Allows those grants to be used to: (1) address the needs of youth who are victims of, or exposed to, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, or stalking; and (2) develop and promote best practices for responding to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, sex trafficking, and stalking. Allows tribal coalition grants to be used to develop and promote legislation and policies that enhance best practices for responding to violent crimes against Indian women. Requires the Attorney General to award such grants annually to: (1) each tribal coalition that meets certain criteria under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (VAWA), is recognized by the Office on Violence Against Women, and serves Indian tribes; and (2) organizations that propose to incorporate and operate a tribal coalition in areas where Indian tribes are located but no tribal coalition exists. Amends the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005 to: (1) include the Secretary of the Interior, in addition to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Attorney General, as a participant in consultations with Indian tribes regarding the administration of tribal funds and programs, enhancement of Indian women's safety, and federal response to violent crimes against Indian women ; and (2) require the National Institute of Justice to include women in Alaska Native Villages and sex trafficking in its study of violence against Indian women. Reauthorizes appropriations for the study for FY2012-FY2013. Amends VAWA to define or revise definitions of &quot;native village,&quot; &quot;sex trafficking,&quot; and &quot;tribal coalition.&quot; Gives Indian tribes criminal jurisdiction over domestic violence, dating violence, and violations of protective orders that occur on their lands. Provides that a participating tribe shall exercise special domestic violence criminal jurisdiction concurrently, not exclusively. Authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to assist Indian tribes in exercising such jurisdiction, providing indigent defendants with free legal counsel, and securing the rights of victims of such crimes. Authorizes appropriations for such grant program and to provide participating Indian tribes with training, technical assistance, data collection, and an evaluation of their criminal justice systems. Gives Indian courts civil jurisdiction to issue and enforce protection orders. Amends the federal criminal code to increase the maximum federal penalties for assault convictions. Subjects individuals who: (1) commit an assault resulting in substantial bodily injury to a spouse, intimate partner, or a dating partner to a fine or imprisonment for up to five years, or both; and (2) assault a spouse, intimate partner, or dating partner by strangling, suffocating, or attempting to strangle or suffocate, by a fine or imprisonment up to 10 years, or both. Makes federal felony assault penalties applicable to Indians. Makes Indian tribes' criminal jurisdiction over domestic violence, dating violence, and violations of protection orders that occur on their lands effective two years after this Act's enactment. Gives Indian tribes the opportunity to participate in a pilot project that allows them to exercise that jurisdiction sooner. Amends the federal criminal code to subject individuals convicted under tribal law of repeat domestic violence or stalking offenses to maximum federal penalty provisions for repeat offenders. Amends the Indian Law Enforcement Reform Act to extend the Indian Law and Order Commission's reporting deadline by one year.
