	5/26/2011--Passed Senate without amendment. (This measure has not been amended since it was introduced. The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.) Designates June 7, 2011, as National Hunger Awareness Day. Calls on the people of the United States to observe National Hunger Awareness Day: (1) with appropriate ceremonies, volunteer activities, and other support for local anti-hunger advocacy efforts and hunger relief charities, including food banks, food rescue organizations, food pantries, soup kitchens, and emergency shelters; and (2) by continuing to support programs and public policies that reduce hunger and food insecurity in the United States.
